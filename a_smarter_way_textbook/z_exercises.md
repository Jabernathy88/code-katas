## Exercises ##

### Ch. 70 ###

If you have a spreadsheet program like Excel that exports to CSV, create a spreadsheet with at least three rows and three columns. Export it to the Desktop as a CSV file.

Alternatively, create a CSV file in IDLEâ€”three lines of three comma-separated values each (no quotation marks, just text). Name the file whatever you like, but end it in .csv. Save it to the Desktop.

Revise the Python program you created in the previous set of exercises to read and display a value in this CSV file. Save the program and run it.

### Ch. 71 ###

You now have several CSV files on the Desktop. Read one of them.
Display its contents.

### Ch. 72 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that creates a CSV file with three rows of three elements each.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

Open the CSV file in IDLE.

### Ch. 73 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that appends a row to one of the CSV files you've already created.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

Open the CSV file in IDLE.

### Ch. 74 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that imports the json module...

...creates a list...

...and writes the list to a JSON file.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

Open the JSON file in IDLE.

### Ch. 75 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that imports the json module...

...reads the JSON file containing a list that you coded in the last chapter...

...and displays the list.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

Open the JSON file in IDLE.

### Ch. 76 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that tries to open a text file for reading. Ask it to open a file that doesn't exist.

If the file isn't found, display a message.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

### Ch. 77 ###

In IDLE code a Python program that asks the user to input a file name, using a while loop to give her another chance to input if there's a FileNotFoundError.

If the file is found, load it. If the file isn't found, display a message.

Save the Python program to the Desktop and run it.

As the user, input a filename for a file that doesn't exist. Then input a filename for a file that does exist.
